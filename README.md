## Description
This is a Python project containing several small, educational programs designed to explore various functionalities of the language.
The project includes the following programs:

* **khansole_academy.py:** This program tests the user's addition skills by generating random addition problems. The user must answer three problems correctly in a row to win. The program also allows the user to quit by entering 0 at any time and includes input validation to ensure the user enters integers only.
* **hailstones.py:** This program explores the Hailstone sequence. It prompts the user for a positive integer and then determines the number of steps required for the number to reach 1 through a specific mathematical sequence.
* **moon_weight.py:** This program calculates the user's weight on the moon based on their weight on Earth. It takes the user's weight as input and converts it using a pre-defined conversion factor. The program also handles invalid inputs like negative numbers or zero.
* **pythagorean.py:** This program calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle when the user provides the lengths of the other two sides. It utilizes the Pythagorean theorem and the math library's square root function.
* **compute_interest.py:** This program calculates the user's future bank account balance based on factors like initial balance, interest rate, and time period. It prompts the user for various inputs and performs calculations to estimate the final balance. The program also includes input validation and allows the user to quit at any time.
* **liftoff.py:** This program simulates a spaceship launch countdown by printing numbers from 10 to 1 followed by "Liftoff!".

## Technologies Used
* Python 3

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnruiz17/khansole-academy-python
```

2. Verify that Python 3 is installed on your system by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python3 --version 
```

## Usage
You can run each program individually from the command line using the following syntax (replace filename.py with the actual filename):

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

For example, to run khansole_academy.py:

```bash
python3 khansole_academy.py
```
